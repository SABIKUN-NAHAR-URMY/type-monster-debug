            <h2>What is the difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage?</h2>
            <p><strong> Answer: </strong> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.As it is not session-based, localStorage must be deleted via javascript or manually. SessionStorage session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.The client  can only read local storage.</p>

            <h2>What is the difference between Global Scope and Local Scope?</h2>
            <p><strong> Answer: </strong> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope.Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it's declared.</p>
