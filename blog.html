            <h2>1) What is the difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage?</h2>
            <p><strong> Answer: </strong> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.As it is not session-based, localStorage must be deleted via javascript or manually. SessionStorage session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.The client  can only read local storage.</p>

            <h2>2) What is the difference between Global Scope and Local Scope?</h2>
            <p><strong> Answer: </strong> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope.Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it's declared.</p>

            <h2>3) How do work Event Loop in javascript?</h2>
            <p><strong> Answer: </strong> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.</p>
